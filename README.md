# Statistical Methods for Data Science II

Professor: PhD. Luca Tardella (https://elearning.uniroma1.it/enrol/index.php?id=14819)

This is an introductory course about Bayesian inference and Bayesian modelling for data analysis. It balances between theoretical and analytical tools and practice. In particular for practical implementation of Bayesian models on real data the course makes use of some software for Bayesian modelling and inference (R, BUGS/JAGS, STAN, INLA).

This course covers:

1) Introduction to Bayesian Thinking
  * Basic definitions, Bayesian model, Bayes’ theorem. Subjective prior elicitation and some noninformative or default prior choices (e.g.
  Jeffreys’Rule). Conjugate analysis. Techniques and tools for characterizing and summarizing posterior distributions. Bayes Factor, introduction to multi-      model inference and Bayesian model choice.

2) Multiparameter Inference
  * This part considers the multivariate normal model and multinomial models and introduce to approximate random sampling from a multivariate distribution. Bayesian inference in the presence of missing data.

3) MC & MCMC
  * Introduction to Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling techniques for approximating expectations and distributions: Gibbs Sampling and Metropolis Hastings algorithms.
